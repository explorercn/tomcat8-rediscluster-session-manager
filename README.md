# tomcat8-rediscluster-session-manager

Currently the "tomcat-redis-session-manager" from "jcoleman" is not supported for Tomcat 8 and redis cluster 3.x.
So both two feature are now integrated into it.

This revised version is only tested in some limited area. So please take into consideration before introduce it into PRODUCTION environment.  

I'm very happy to know if you find any issue during your testing.
